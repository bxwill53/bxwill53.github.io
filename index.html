        <h1> Mcgregor taking over the roster</h1>
        <p> In almost 2 years Mcgregor had climbed his way to the number one contender spot. He first started his career in 2008. In 2012 he won the Featherweight and Lightweight for a company named Cage Warrior. He then signed with the UFC in 2013 to truy test himself and make some real money. From there he climbed the ladder and dominated all of his oppenents, finishing almost all of them. Finally at UFC 194 he fought Jose Aldo for the featherweight championship. This wpuld be the fight that launched Mcgregor into the mainstream because he knocked Aldo out in just 13 seconds of the first round. Now with the Featherweight belt on one shoulderhe had his eyes on the lightweight belt. So at UFC 205 after the second round, Mcgregor's arm was raised and the lightweight championship belt was placed on his other shoulder. He became the first mma fighter in history to hold two world titles simultaneoiusly. </p>
